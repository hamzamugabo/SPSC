Cashier goes missing  lover arrested,I pity Uganda Police Bambi. Instead of summoning the poor boy to record a statement   they just proceed to arrest as though they have envidence. I cry loud oh poor Ugandan. Ugandan Detectives shd be sent to USA to study how and why crimes are committed.
Cashier goes missing  lover arrested,Poor sentence construction. That headline means: The police have arrested two people who went missing under mysterious circumstances. One of those missing persons was the boyfriend of a middle-aged woman. In that case  it is even useless to try to redeem the use of the adjective middle-aged on a 28year old woman.

Agaba rose above mental illness to shine at S7,I have a bone to pick with journalists. Every time UNEB results are out  they go out to schools to extort money from management and owners who they convenience that it's a form of advertising to have their best candidates in the papers. They even fabricate statistics showing the best schools and if you critically analyse the list  you realise it has more private schools known for placing adverts.what ever parameters they use to come to this conclusion  they them selves know better.

Mountains of the Moon University applies for gov't take over,The former executive director of NCHE  Prof ABK Kasozi once said that universities cannot only depend and rely on tuition fees as a source of their income to support operations. Those that did  would either merge with bigger ones  be taken over by government or collapse and close. This has come to pass.
Mountains of the Moon University applies for gov't take over,This will cause regional imbalance  so there are 3 public universities this will not be a fair move

Mountains of the Moon University applies for gov't take over,MMU is one of the best Universities we have today in Uganda  I guess giving it to our fake military government is a move to backsliding it. The community should join hands together with the Tooro Kingdom cause the got money and make it shine the more #BatooroGetSerious

Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,Those people love protesting. From King Henry time when he organised for leaving of Catholic church calling for Protestant Refomation. To today in Uganda. Protestants are always Protesting will there name shall remain Protestants even in Heaven.
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,That z why they are called  protestants  n infact d first rioter in d history of d catholic church z their founder - Martin Luther King.
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,Church issues are always solved within the Church and don't use your riches in Ankole to interfere with God's work.Remember God gave you riches but if turn against him then He will also turn against you.Remember religious leaders are God's ambassadors and you either receive blessings or curshes from them.so don't take your politics to c Church
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,What is this man's stand on  Togikwatako'?? That might be the source of his troubles
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,Looks there is a hidden sponsor!! Why now???
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,All they want is to be under south ankole diocese which they say is nearer compared to where they're currently.
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,It's nothing. They are just being Protestants.
Why Ankole Christians protested against Bishop Mwesigwa,Let them use official means to join South Ankole political demonstrations are not necessary.

2 700 prisoners tipped for presidential pardon,That Sharma Kooky fella should have been shot. He savagely electrocuted the wife
3 700 prisoners tipped for presidential pardon,But keweesi murder suspects pardoned themselves kuba they know themselves and where are they tubawe kubilabo byakulisimansi
4 700 prisoners tipped for presidential pardon,I haven't read the post but my suggestion is that they make a mass grave for everyone who voted for yes. Where did Kibweteri of Kanungu go. He should come and work on the yes men
5 700 prisoners tipped for presidential pardon,That's good news  a welcome gesture to herald a new 7-year term  which should usher in reconciliation after differences of political opinion had kept people apart. It's a godsend chance for the will-be-released inmates to fit well in society  gaining acceptance within their native communities. The population has to forgive them for offences of the past (for which they've already served sentences) & give them new leases of life. References to the gravity of offences committed  as the case was with Kooky  would be injurious to the wellbeing of these returnees to 'normal life'. Let's forgive their past. Who doesn't err at one point or another? We're treading along a new path  shaping a new Uganda for the better.....let's welcome them with brotherly love. There's no room for reprisals. A good 'mark' of statesmanship.
6 700 prisoners tipped for presidential pardon,It may not sound good to the opponent side bt thanks our beloved president for having parental heart .
